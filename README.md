# Forecasting-ARIMAX-Model

The standard ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average) model allows to make forecasts based only on the past values of the forecast variable. The model assumes that future values of a variable linearly depend on its past values, as well as on the values of past (stochastic) shocks. The ARIMAX model is an extended version of the ARIMA model. It includes also other independent (predictor) variables. The model is also referred to as the vector ARIMA or the dynamic regression model.
The ARIMAX model is similar to a multivariate regression model, but allows to take advantage of autocorrelation that may be present in residuals of the regression to improve the accuracy of a forecast.
